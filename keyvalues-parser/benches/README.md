Currently the benchmark just covers parsing the `tests/app_info.vdf` file which is a reasonably large VDF file that should be a good representation of a typical VDF file. Running the benchmark on a computer with a Ryzen 7 3700 yielded 24.7 Î¼s for parsing the VDF file at a rate of 103 MiB/s. You can run the bencmarks for the parser yourself by running either `cargo bench` or `cargo criterion` from the `keyvalues-parser` directory.
